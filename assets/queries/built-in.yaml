    # The command(s) executed should output varnishlog logs in plain text.
    # If you're running Varnish locally, the command can be just `varnishlog`.
    # You can also use `ssh`, `docker exec`, or a simple `cat ~/my.log` to provide them,
    # as long as the command is not interactive.

    # Write the command as if you were writing it in a shell script.

    # Lines that start with a "#" or are empty will be ignored.
    # Concatenate lines belonging to the same command with a '\' at the end.

    # Press 'e' to edit or 'q' to view more examples.
